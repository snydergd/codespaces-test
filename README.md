# Haikus for Codespaces

This is a quick node project template for demoing Codespaces. It is based off of the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). It's great!!!


# WHat makes this project special?

The rich purple background.  Mmm, have to love that rich dark purple color and it compliments the purple in Octocat's accessories so nicely.
